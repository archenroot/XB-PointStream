**The demo currently only works with Firefox :( **

Steps for fun:

1. Buy a fast computer.

2. Download the Animation Data 1 and 2 here:
http://code.google.com/p/radiohead/downloads/list

3. Unzip the csv animation files and place them in the "clouds" directory.
The script will reference:
"clouds/1.csv"
"clouds/2.csv"
â€¦
So do not add subdirectories.

4. Tinker with the shader.vs file.

5. Run the demo!
